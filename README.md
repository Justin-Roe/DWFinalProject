# Data Wrangling Final Project

By Justin Roe

The movie landscape has changed dramatically over the past decade. With the rise of streaming services getting sooner access to blockbuster hits and Covid-19 temporarily halting movie theater attendance, production companies need to be more careful with their future movie endeavors as one box office bust could result in serious budget cuts or business closure. As movies find their way onto streaming services quicker, meaning fewer physical purchases, and the decline of ‚Äúmovie theater culture‚Äù due to Covid, it is more important that ever to do research when determining what kind of movie should be made next. This project aims to do just that. Asking what people want to see and how ratings and award nominations are correlated with a movies not only financial, but overall success.

The README.md within the "Codes" folder contains the Python files made when developing this project as well as an explaination as to what what each python file accomplishes.

The README.md in the "Data" folder contains the data dictionary as well as the original Kaggle set used and the website that the additional information was scraped from.

Below is a link to the project proposal. This outlines the motivation behind the project as well as the proposed analysis of the data.
