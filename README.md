# DWFinalProject

The movie landscape has changed dramatically over the past decade. With the rise of streaming services getting sooner access to blockbuster hits and Covid-19 temporarily halting movie theater attendance, production companies need to be more careful with their future movie endeavors as one box office bust could result in serious budget cuts or business closure. As movies find their way onto streaming services quicker, meaning fewer physical purchases, and the decline of “movie theater culture” due to Covid, it is more important that ever to do research when determining what kind of movie should be made next. This project aims to do just that. Asking what people want to see and how ratings and award nominations are correlated with a movies not only financial, but overall success.

The Codes folder contains the Python files used during the development of this project. The README.md within the Codes folder explains what each python file accomplishes.

The README.md in the "Data" folder contains the data dictionary as well as the original Kaggle set used and the website that the additional information was scraped from.
